No woman no cry  
Cause I remember when we used to sit  
In a government yard in trenchtown  
Observing the hypocrites  
Mingle with the good people we meet  
Good friends we have, now  
Good friends we have lost  
Along the way  
In this great future,  
You can't forget your past  
So dry your tears, I say  
  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry  
Oh little darling,  
Don't shed no tears  
No woman no cry  
  
Cause I remember when we used to sit  
In the government yard in trenchtown  
When Georgie would make  
The fire lights  
I say, log would burnin'  
Through the nights  
Then we would cook cornmeal porridge  
Of which I'll share with you  
My feet is my only carriage  
So I've got to push on thru,  
  
And while I'm gone  
Everything 's gonna be alright  
Everything 's gonna be alright  
Everything 's gonna be alright now  
  
Everything 's gonna be alright  
Everything 's gonna be alright now  
Everything 's gonna be alright  
No woman no cry  
  
No woman no cry  
Oh little darlin'  
Don't shed no tears  
No woman no cry  
Oh little darlin'  
Don't shed no tears  
No woman no cry  
No woman no cry
