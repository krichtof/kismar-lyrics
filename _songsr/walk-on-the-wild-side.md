Holly came from Miami, FLA  
Hitch-hiked her way across the USA  
Plucked her eyebrows on the way  
Shaved her legs and then he was a she  
  
She says, Hey babe  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
She said, Hey honey  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
  
Candy came from out on the Island  
In the backroom she was everybody's darlin'  
But she never lost her head  
Even when she was giving head  
  
She says, Hey babe  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
Said, Hey babe  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
  
And the colored girls go doo do doo do doo do do doo, ....  
  
Little Joe never once gave it away  
Everybody had to pay and pay  
A hussle here and a hussle there  
New York City's the place where they said, Hey babe  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
  
I said, Hey Joe  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
  
Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets  
Lookin' for soul food and a place to eat  
Went to the Apollo  
You should've seen 'em go go go  
  
They said, Hey sugar  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
I Said, Hey babe  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
  
  
  
  
All right, huh  
Jackie is just speeding away  
Thought she was James Dean for a day  
Then I guess she had to crash  
Valium would have helped that bash  
  
Said, Hey babe,  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
I said, Hey honey,  
Take a Walk On The Wild Side  
  
And the colored girls say, doo do doo do doo do do doo
