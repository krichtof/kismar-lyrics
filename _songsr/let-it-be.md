When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, Let It Be.  
And in my hour of darkness  
She is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, Let It Be.  
Let It Be, Let It Be. Let It Be, Let It Be.  
Whisper words of wisdom, Let It Be.  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Living in the world agree,  
There will be an answer, Let It Be.  
For though they may be parted there is  
Still a chance that they will see There will be an answer, Let It Be.  
Let It Be, Let It Be. Let It Be, Let It Be.  
Yeah, There will be an answer, Let It Be.  
Let It Be, Let It Be. Let It Be, Let It Be.  
Whisper words of wisdom, Let It Be.  
Let It Be, Let It Be. Let It Be, Let It Be.  
There will be an answer, Let It Be. (instrumental break)  
Let It Be, Let It Be. Let It Be, Let It Be.  
There will be an answer, Let It Be.  
  
And when the night is cloudy,  
There is still a light that shines on me.  
Shine until tomorrow, Let It Be.  
I wake up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me   
Speaking words of wisdom, Let It Be.  
Let It Be, Let It Be. Let It Be, Let It Be.  
There will be no sorrow, Let It Be.  
Let It Be, Let It Be. Let It Be, Let It Be.  
Whisper words of wisdom, Let It Be hoooo' hoooo'
